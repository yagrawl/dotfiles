# dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles for customizing Neovim, Tmux, Zsh, and Git on macOS.

## Introduction

As you may note, it isn't the prettiest thing (yet!). You can never reach a state where your development environment is absolutely perfect. Especially when you are working with a highly customizable setup like Neovim and Tmux. There are always new plugins to add or tweaks to be made. That in itself can feel intimidating and overwhelming. My initial approach is to get to a usable system with features matching a traditional IDE (e.g., VSCode) and then making changes occasionally (~ every few months) to remove things I haven't used and to add features that will make me more productive.

## Components

This configuration brings together various components to craft an IDE-like experience within the terminal. Core elements include:

- Terminal: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) - a replacement for macOS's default terminal
- Shell: [Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/)
- Session Management: [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) - for creating multiple windows, split panes, and managing sessions
- Text Editor: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - a more advanced version of Vim

### Dependencies

Each component relies on specific dependencies. I utilize [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/) for shell configuration, [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) to manage Tmux plugins, [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) for Neovim plugins, and additional plugins to enhance IDE features.

## Installation

Before diving into the setup, ensure that you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) set up on your system.

Install iTerm2:
```
brew install --cask iterm2

```

Install zsh
```
brew install zsh
```

Zsh dependencies
```
# Install Oh My Zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# Install Powerlevel10k for Oh My Zsh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/powerlevel10k
```

Install tmux and plugin manager
```
brew install tmux

git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Install neovim with packer
```
brew install neovim

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

## Setup

Clone this repository in the `~` directory. The setup script currently assumes that as the location:
```
cd ~ && git clone git@github.com:yagrawl/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles
```

Run the setup script with `./setup.sh`. This will establish symbolic links between the repository and where applications anticipate the configuration files. For instance, the Tmux setup, stored in `~/dotfiles/.tmux.conf`, links to `~/.tmux.conf`.

**Note**: Although the included `.vimrc` is part of these dotfiles, feel free to skip the symlink creation since Neovim is preferred.

## Fonts

For fonts, find one you like at [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). I keep switching between [MesloLG](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#meslo) and [Inconsolata](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#inconsolata)
